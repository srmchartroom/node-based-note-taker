# node-based-note-taker &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ES6-red)

## Description

The application package is a node.js-based program that leverages express for server creation and can be deployed and run locally (localhost:8080) or deployed to a remote server such as Heroku. The application provides a browser-based interface for users to create notes, review them, and delete them, with the notes list persisting after browser-session ends, and regardless of browser accessed from. This allows users to use the app to jot down ideas, snippets or notes, and store them, recall them for review, and remove them when done with them.

## Tests

Be sure to test the application after installation and deploying it. No jest-based automated tests or otherwise have been developed for this particular project. But successful execution can be quickly confirmed by simply running the application in the browser after launching the application (e.g. `node app.js`) . To complete this, simply follow the installation instructions above. Additional context and instruction can be reviewed in the video provided above under [usage](#usage).
